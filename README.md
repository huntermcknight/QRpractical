# Qualitative Bathtub Analysis
Automated qualitative reasoner practical for UvA Master AI Knowledge Representation course

Based on a qualitative model of the interrelationships between inflow, outflow, and volume for a generic bathtub, and an initial
scenario, this reasoner builds an interactive state graph for a simulated tub. 

For more information on our underlying model, scenario, and other assumptions, see our report. 

## Getting Started
### Scripts
Scripts are written in Python for version 3.5.2. The following pydot package is also necessary for graph plotting.

### Running the reasoner
To start the reasoner, simply execute
```
python state_graph.py
```
The state graph will be output as state_graph.png.
